### Forked from [puzzledqs/BBox-Label-Tool](https://github.com/puzzledqs/BBox-Label-Tool)
## Improvements
1. Add multi-class support 
2. Change some of the color-candidates for better display
3. Fix the 'Example' filepath for convenience
4. Change the image format from '.JPEG' to '.JPG'

## New Usage
### For multi-class task, modify 'class.txt' with your own class-candidates and before labeling bbox, choose the 'Current Class' in the Combobox and make sure you click 'ComfirmClass' button.

### The remaining usage is the same as the origin one.

Environment

Run
-------
$ python main.py

Usage
-----
0. The current tool requires that **the images to be labeled reside in /Images/001, /Images/002, etc. You will need to modify the code if you want to label images elsewhere**.
1. Input a folder number (e.g, 1, 2, 5...), and click `Load`. The images in the folder, along with a few example results will be loaded.
2. To create a new bounding box, left-click to select the first vertex. Moving the mouse to draw a rectangle, and left-click again to select the second vertex.
  - To cancel the bounding box while drawing, just press `<Esc>`.
  - To delete a existing bounding box, select it from the listbox, and click `Delete`.
  - To delete all existing bounding boxes in the image, simply click `ClearAll`.
3. After finishing one image, click `Next` to advance. Likewise, click `Prev` to reverse. Or, input an image id and click `Go` to navigate to the speficied image.
  - Be sure to click `Next` after finishing a image, or the result won't be saved.
